Let me write a little about myself, not that it's important to you or me, it's just because I need to fill the space in the "About" section with something.

I'm Thiago Augusto Ozores, also known as Zoz√¥, I've been working with Information Technology for over 15 years ~~saying I don't fix printers~~ and trying to explain to other people what I do, only to discover that I can't even explain it to myself.

I'm an admirer of:
- Arch Linux
- Kubernetes and its ecosystem
- Python
- Grafana+Prometheus
- Star Trek
- Doctor Who
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- Pink Floyd
- History of Brazil and the World
- And many more, but the list would be too long and also because I'm tired of writing.
