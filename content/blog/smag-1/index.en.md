## Preamble

I was thinking about what to write about when I relaunched my blog and it came into my head to tell a story that has nothing to do with IT, although it does and it may be based on real events or it may just be a story, a fisherman's tale, but I'll leave you with the benefit of the doubt.

The story I'm going to tell is that of the Supreme Master Analyst of the Galaxies (and that's what I'm going to call him; he could very well be in a Marvel story), a guy who has a wisdom and knowledge of information technology, computer science and various other subjects that is beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals, which is why he is totally misunderstood in this universe and is also a person who has a humility the size of a supermassive black hole (contains irony and sarcasm).

But let's get to the story, and you'll better understand the reason for the adjectives above.

## The story

It was lunch in the office cafeteria, back in the days ~~when the continents were together~~ when people went to work face-to-face (although I think we're going back to those days) and just like every lunch between coworkers, there were several ~~gossipy~~ topics on the agenda.

And then, on one of these subjects, which I can't remember what it was, the Supreme Master Analyst of the Galaxies grabbed everyone's attention like a speeding train hitting a car that was crossing the tracks at the time (he loved doing that).

And so he begins to tell his story, that he had traveled to a friend's farm and that it was a eucalyptus farm and, if I remember correctly, it was in the interior of São Paulo, as he tells it.

This friend had confided to the Master (I'll abbreviate it from now on) that he had bought some new tractors for the farm in order to use them to help cut down the eucalyptus trees and that the farm staff were unable to use the new equipment, even the most experienced tractor drivers (I don't know if tractors are the right equipment for this type of work, I'm just telling the story as he told it).

Then the Master turns to his friend and says:<br/> - Where's the tractor? I want to drive it, it shouldn't be difficult (although I don't remember if that's exactly what he said, but it was said with unparalleled humility).

The friend, clearly charmed by the Master's humility, granted him the right.

He continues the story by saying that he was able to drive and operate the tractor first time and that in the driving test he had already made several maneuvers that left the employees and his friend, the owner of the farm, speechless.

He then asked his friend which eucalyptus trees had to be felled and his friend pointed to the area where they were.

Taming the tractor like a rider tames a horse, he sets off to take down the eucalyptus trees (poetic license, because I don't remember exactly how it was said, but it wasn't very different from that) and he makes an unprecedented maneuver with the tractor that left the farm employees once again bewildered and applauding him, and they even named the maneuver after him and with that he manages to cut down some eucalyptus trees (now it's not poetic license, he really said that).

After this feat, he gathers all the farm workers together and passes on the knowledge of how to drive the tractor to them. The employees thank him and finish felling the other eucalyptus trees.

And now we return to the office cafeteria. In the middle of the story, one of our colleagues was sitting at the table. Like me, he was unable to understand the vastness of the Master's wisdom. Some were completely disoriented and bewildered. Others lost their patience because they were unable to discern. That was what happened to our colleague. He got up from the table and said:<br/> - "I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN STAND IT!" - And he left the cafeteria.

Afterwards, many people followed him, because they had already finished their lunch and it was time to go back to work.

## Epilogue

This story is just one of the Master's many stories, a story that can be fiction as well as not, depending on who is reading it and the moment of the reader, in other words, it's a Schrödinger story.

Maybe in the future I'll come back with other stories of his, with some that are directly related to IT, who knows, it will depend on the number of views and if I don't get sued.

And I'm sure that after reading this, you'll remember some Master who worked with you and who is either a know-it-all or a friend of the know-it-all, a guy who simply can't say “I don't know” and always wants to be above others.

IN THE MEANTIME, KEEP TUNING IN TO THE BLOG FOR RELEVANT SUBJECTS, I SWEAR THERE WILL BE.
